> Imagine that you are an architect that has pragmatic hands-on experience and has abilities to apply strategic Domain-Driven Design where the bussines area is related to a system that helps managing medical appointments.
Main actors are people in the back-office (working with administering), front-office (working directly with customers and patients) and helping doctors providing their services.
Suggest Context Mapping between various subareas within such an organization

> I'll develop a Context Mapping strategy for a medical appointment management system, focusing on strategic Domain-Driven Design principles.

## Context Mapping Approach:

1. Appointment Management Bounded Context
  - Core Context: Central to the entire system
  - Manages scheduling, rescheduling, and tracking patient appointments
  - Integrates with other contexts through well-defined interfaces
2. Patient Registration Context
  - Supporting Context to Appointment Management
  - Handles patient profile creation, insurance verification, and medical history
  - Upstream Context providing critical data for appointment scheduling
3. Medical Staff Management Context
  - Conformist Context to Appointment Management
  - Manages doctor profiles, availability, specializations
  - Provides availability data that constrains appointment scheduling
4. Billing and Payment Context
  - Customer/Supplier Relationship with Appointment Management
  - Processes invoices, insurance claims, and payment tracking
  - Downstream from Appointment Management, receives scheduling details
5. Notification and Communication Context
  - Partnership Context
  - Sends appointment reminders, confirmations, and updates
  - Bi-directional communication with Appointment Management

## Integration Patterns:

- Anti-Corruption Layer between contexts to maintain data integrity
- Event-driven communication for real-time updates
- Shared kernel for common medical terminology and core data structures

## Recommended Technical Implementation:

- Microservices architecture
- Event sourcing for appointment state changes
- GraphQL or gRPC for inter-service communication
- Eventual consistency model

This strategic design ensures modularity, scalability, and clear boundaries between different organizational sub-domains.

## Key innovation opportunities:

1. AI-Powered Predictive Scheduling
  - Predict appointment durations based on patient history and procedure types
  - Optimize doctor schedules using machine learning
  - Reduce waiting times and improve resource utilization
2. Digital Health Integration
  - Remote consultation scheduling and management
  - Integration with wearable devices for health monitoring
  - Automated pre-appointment patient data collection
3. Smart Patient Engagement
  - Personalized communication based on patient preferences
  - Automated follow-up scheduling
  - Health milestone tracking and preventive care reminders
4. Real-time Resource Management
  - Dynamic pricing for off-peak appointments
  - Equipment and room utilization optimization
  - Staff allocation based on predicted patient flow
5. Data Analytics Platform
  - Patient behavior analysis
  - Treatment outcome tracking
  - Healthcare trend identification for business strategy

These innovations could significantly improve operational efficiency, patient satisfaction, and healthcare delivery quality.

## Bounded Contexts

For each bounded context, here are the key concepts and ubiquitous language:

### Appointment Management (Core)
- Scheduling: Time allocation, slot management, scheduling conflicts
- Visit Types: Consultation patterns, treatment sessions, follow-ups
- Availability Window: Time blocks, booking constraints
- Appointment Status: Confirmed, pending, completed, cancelled

### Patient Registration
- Patient Journey: Care pathway, treatment history
- Medical Coverage: Insurance verification, coverage limits
- Patient Status: Active, inactive, referred
- Care Requirements: Special needs, accommodations

### Medical Staff Management
- Clinical Expertise: Specializations, qualifications
- Service Provision: Treatment capabilities, consultation types
- Working Pattern: Availability rules, service hours
- Staff Capacity: Workload management, maximum patients

### Billing & Payment
- Payment Processing: Transaction handling, refunds
- Insurance Claims: Claim submission, verification
- Service Pricing: Fee structures, payment plans
- Revenue Cycle: Billing workflow, payment tracking

### Notification & Communication
- Communication Channels: Contact preferences, notification methods
- Message Templates: Standardized communications
- Alert Priority: Urgency levels, response requirements
- Engagement Pattern: Follow-up sequences, reminder schedules

Each context's language reflects its specific responsibility while maintaining consistency within its boundary.

## Core Business Archetypes in the Medical Appointment System:

1. Party Archetype
  - Represents doctors, patients, staff
  - Handles relationships and roles
  - Manages contact information and preferences
2. Product/Service Archetype
  - Medical services/procedures offered
  - Appointment types and durations
  - Treatment packages
3. Order Archetype
  - Appointment bookings
  - Service requests
  - Resource allocation
4. Inventory Archetype
  - Time slots availability
  - Room/equipment management
  - Staff scheduling capacity
5. Rule Archetype
  - Booking policies
  - Payment terms
  - Insurance requirements
6. Money Archetype
  - Payment processing
  - Fee calculations
  - Insurance claims

These archetypes form the foundational patterns for organizing the domain model across contexts.
