  - **Healing Before Implants**: A patient must complete any necessary restorative treatments (e.g., fillings or root canals) on a tooth before being considered for a dental implant in that area to ensure the implant has a healthy foundation.
  - **Periodontal Evaluation for Dentures**: Patients must undergo a periodontal evaluation to assess gum health before being fitted for dentures, as unhealthy gums can lead to complications with denture fit and function.
  **Orthodontic Treatment Preceding Restorative Work**: Patients requiring braces must complete orthodontic treatment before undergoing restorative procedures (e.g., crowns or bridges) to ensure proper alignment and occlusion.
  - **Root Canal Therapy Before Crowns**: A tooth that has undergone root canal therapy must be fitted with a crown within a specified timeframe to protect the tooth from fracture and restore its function.
  - **Regular Check-Ups for Implant Maintenance**: Patients with dental implants are required to have regular check-ups every six months to monitor the health of the surrounding tissues and ensure the longevity of the implant.
- pregnancy care
  - **First Trimester Screening**: Pregnant women should have their first antenatal appointment before 12 weeks of gestation to assess overall health, perform blood tests for conditions like syphilis and HIV, and provide essential dietary and lifestyle counseling.
  - **Regular Monitoring for Gestational Diabetes**: Women should be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, especially if they have risk factors such as obesity or a family history of diabetes, to ensure timely management and reduce complications.
  - **Ultrasound for Fetal Development**: An ultrasound scan is recommended between 18 to 21 weeks to monitor fetal growth, check for anomalies, and determine the position of the placenta, which is crucial for planning the delivery.
  - **Tetanus Vaccination**: Pregnant women should receive the tetanus toxoid vaccine during pregnancy to protect both themselves and their newborns from neonatal tetanus, particularly if they have not been vaccinated in the last ten years.
  - **Mental Health Assessment**: Healthcare providers should conduct mental health assessments at each antenatal visit to identify signs of stress, anxiety, or depression, ensuring that mothers receive appropriate support throughout their pregnancy to promote overall well-being.
- internist (no specialization)
  - **Annual Preventive Screenings**: Internists should conduct comprehensive annual physical exams that include blood tests for cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and other relevant markers to identify potential health issues early.
  - **Referral for Specialist Care**: If a patient presents with symptoms indicating a need for specialized care (e.g., persistent abdominal pain suggesting gastrointestinal issues), the internist must refer the patient to the appropriate specialist (e.g., gastroenterologist) within a specified time frame.
  - **Vaccination Schedule Compliance**: Internists are responsible for ensuring patients are up-to-date on vaccinations, including annual flu shots and other recommended immunizations based on age and health status, particularly for patients with chronic illnesses.
  - **Mental Health Screening**: During routine visits, internists should perform mental health screenings for conditions like depression or anxiety, especially in patients with chronic illnesses, to ensure comprehensive care and timely referrals to mental health professionals if needed.
  - **Chronic Disease Management**: Patients diagnosed with chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes must have regular follow-up appointments scheduled every three to six months to monitor their health status and adjust treatment plans as necessary.
- oncology
  - **Oncology Follow-Up After Treatment**: Patients receiving treatment from an oncologist must have a follow-up appointment scheduled within three months post-treatment.
  - **Chemotherapy Sequencing**: Patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer must receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery to shrink tumors, followed by adjuvant therapy to eliminate residual disease, ensuring optimal outcomes.
  - **Radiation Therapy Timing**: Patients receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancers should complete their radiation treatment before undergoing reconstructive surgery, as healing from radiation can complicate surgical recovery and outcomes.
  - **Genomic Testing Prior to Targeted Therapy**: Before starting targeted therapies (e.g., for lung cancer), patients must undergo comprehensive genomic testing to identify actionable mutations, ensuring that the selected treatment is tailored to the specific characteristics of their tumor.
  - **Palliative Care Integration**: Oncology patients should have palliative care consultations initiated early in their treatment process, ideally at diagnosis, to manage symptoms and improve quality of life alongside curative treatments.
  - **Follow-Up Imaging After Treatment**: Patients treated for colorectal cancer must have follow-up imaging (e.g., CT scans) scheduled at regular intervals post-treatment (e.g., every 6 months for the first two years) to monitor for recurrence and manage any complications promptly.
